# NeoSkript Conformance Coverage

Reference: **Skript 2.15.3** — generated from `inventory.json` by `coverage.py`.

Tiers: **`done`** = implemented and covered by a behaviour test (strongest). **`parse-verified`** = implemented (getter/pattern translated faithfully from Skript) and confirmed to parse/register, but its runtime behaviour can't be asserted under MockBukkit (which stubs out most live Bukkit calls). **Verified = done + parse-verified** is the headline coverage. `external` = third-party-plugin syntax (excluded). `todo` = not yet implemented.
